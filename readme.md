# Canvas Shader Development Guides

This is a place for community-driven Canvas shader development guides.

[https://spiralhalo.github.io/canvas-shader-guide/](https://spiralhalo.github.io/canvas-shader-guide/)

## Contributing to the Guide

This is meant to be community-driven, so contributions are encouraged!

There isn't a style guide at the moment, but the following has been done:

- Step by step file creation are shown by enclosing the file / folder path in a code block.

```
just/like/this.txt
```

- Generic names are prefixed with `"my_"`. Example: `"my_pack"`, `"my_namespace"`, `"my_pipeline"`, etc.

- The guide is mostly presented as a generalized tutorial with specific examples provided

### For non-shader developer

You can still contribute by turning FREX Shader API documentations from the shader file comments into markdown files!

The file structure would be `docs/frex/apiname.md`. For example `world.h` would translate to `world.md`. I will handle proper formatting later.
